# Skill: Tem Release Protocol

## When to use

Use this skill for EVERY release to main. No exceptions. This is the complete, battle-tested protocol derived from the v3.4.0 Tem Gaze release. It covers everything from compilation gates to README updates to merge and push.

**Trigger phrases:** "release", "merge to main", "push to main", "ship it", "version bump", "prepare release"

## The Protocol

Execute every step in order. Do not skip steps. Do not reorder. Record all metrics as you go.

---

### Phase 1: Compilation Gates

ALL four must pass. If any fails, fix before proceeding.

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --workspace --all-features
```

If `cargo fmt` fails, run `cargo fmt --all` then re-check.

Record the test count:
```bash
cargo test --workspace --all-features 2>&1 | grep "^test result:" | awk '{sum += $4} END {print "Tests: " sum}'
```

Record the crate count:
```bash
ls crates/ | wc -l
```

Note any pre-existing test failures (failures that also exist on the current main branch). These are acceptable if documented. New failures are NOT acceptable.

---

### Phase 2: Version Bump

**Single source of truth:** `Cargo.toml` line ~27

```toml
[workspace.package]
version = "X.Y.Z"
```

**Versioning rules:**
- **Major (X):** Breaking API changes, architecture overhaul
- **Minor (Y):** New features, new crates, new capabilities
- **Patch (Z):** Bug fixes, documentation, minor improvements

After bumping, run `cargo check --workspace` to verify it propagates to all crates.

---

### Phase 3: README.md Updates

Search and update ALL of these. Use `grep` to find them:

**Version references:**
```bash
grep -n "version.*[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+" README.md
```
- Version badge: `version-X.Y.Z-blue`
- Any inline version references

**Test count references:**
```bash
grep -n "tests" README.md
```
- Hero line: `<code>N tests</code>`
- Stats table: `<strong>N</strong><br><sub>Tests</sub>`
- Dev section: `cargo test --workspace  # N tests`

**Architecture tree:**
```bash
grep -n "temm1e-" README.md | head -30
```
- Verify ALL crates in `crates/` are listed in the architecture tree
- If a new crate was added, add it in alphabetical position with a one-line description
- Update the temm1e-tools description if new tools were added

**Feature flags:**
- If a new feature flag was added, add build instructions in the appropriate section
- Example format:
  ```
  **Feature Name** (brief description):
  ```bash
  cargo build --release --features feature-name
  ```

**Release timeline:**
- Add new entry at the TOP of the release timeline (inside the `<details>` block)
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD  vX.Y.Z  ●━━━ One-line summary. Details. Test count`
- Include: what was added, key metrics, test count

---

### Phase 4: CLAUDE.md Updates

```bash
grep -n "crates" CLAUDE.md
```

- Line ~7: Crate count ("The codebase is a Cargo workspace with N crates plus a root binary")
- Workspace structure section: Add new crate entries if applicable
- Any stale references to test counts or feature lists

---

### Phase 5: Setup Documentation

**SETUP_FOR_PROS.md:**
```bash
grep -n "tests" SETUP_FOR_PROS.md
```
- Update test count in the compilation gate comment
- Add new feature flags to the optional features section

**docs/dev/getting-started.md:**
- Update the feature flags table if new features were added
- Mark default features with "— **default**"

**SETUP_FOR_NEWBIE.md:**
- Check for any stale version references

---

### Phase 6: Distribution Parity — install.sh Must Match cargo install

**Principle:** A user who runs `install.sh` should get the same capabilities as `cargo install --git`. Every default feature must ship in the pre-built binary. If it can't (system lib limitation), document the gap clearly.

**Three distribution paths must stay in sync:**

| Path | Config File | What It Builds |
|------|------------|----------------|
| `cargo install` (source) | `Cargo.toml` default features | All defaults — user's compiler handles platform deps |
| `install.sh` (pre-built) | `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Must match defaults. Platform-specific exclusions documented. |
| Docker | `Dockerfile` FEATURES arg | Must match defaults + any extras (tui, etc.) |

**When adding a new default feature, update ALL THREE:**

1. **Cargo.toml** `[features] default = [...]` — add the feature
2. **release.yml** — verify macOS builds include it (they use defaults automatically). For Linux musl: if the feature needs system C libraries that can't statically link, explicitly exclude it with `--no-default-features --features list,without,it` and document why.
3. **Dockerfile** — add to `FEATURES` arg. If the feature needs system dev libs, add `apt-get install` in the builder stage. If it needs runtime libs, add them in the runtime stage.

**Current platform-specific gaps (document in README if any exist):**

| Feature | macOS (install.sh) | Linux musl (install.sh) | Docker | cargo install |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|--------|--------------|
| desktop-control | Yes | **No** (wayland/xcb can't musl-link) | Yes | Yes |

If a gap exists, add a note in README under the feature's build instructions explaining the alternative path (e.g., "Linux binary users: build from source or use Docker").

**Verification checklist for install.sh parity:**
```bash
# 1. Check what defaults are
grep 'default = ' Cargo.toml

# 2. Check what release CI builds for macOS (should be just defaults)
grep 'cargo build' .github/workflows/release.yml

# 3. Check what Docker builds
grep 'FEATURES=' Dockerfile

# 4. All three should list the same features (minus platform exclusions)
```

---

### Phase 7: Docker Verification

**Dockerfile:**
- The `FEATURES` ARG must include ALL default features plus any extras for Docker (e.g., `tui`)
- If a new default feature needs build-time C libraries: add `apt-get install` in the builder stage
- If it needs runtime libraries: add them in the runtime stage
- Verify the Rust version in `FROM rust:X.Y-bookworm` is >= the MSRV
- Current builder deps: `libwayland-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-shm0-dev libxkbcommon-dev` (for xcap)
- Current runtime deps: `libxcb1 libxcb-randr0 libxcb-shm0 libxkbcommon0` (for xcap)

**docker-compose.yml:**
- No changes needed unless environment variables changed

---

### Phase 8: CI Verification

**.github/workflows/ci.yml:**
- CI runs `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features` — this includes ALL feature-gated crates
- If a new feature flag was added, it is automatically covered by `--all-features`
- **If new crate dependencies require system libraries (C libs, pkg-config):** add `apt-get install` to the `Install system dependencies` step in the `check` job
- Current system deps installed in CI: `libwayland-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-shm0-dev libxkbcommon-dev` (for xcap/desktop-control)
- **Test this locally first:** `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features` must pass on your machine before pushing. If it passes locally but fails in CI, the difference is missing system libraries on the Ubuntu runner.

**Common CI failures from new features:**
| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `pkg-config ... was not found` | New crate needs a C library | Add `apt-get install libXXX-dev` to CI |
| `wayland-sys build failed` | xcap needs Wayland libs on Linux | Already fixed: `libwayland-dev` installed |
| `failed to link` on musl target | C library not available for musl | Exclude feature from musl build in release.yml |
| Clippy passes locally (macOS) but fails in CI (Linux) | Platform-specific deps | Add Linux-specific `apt-get install` |

**.github/workflows/release.yml:**
- macOS builds use defaults — automatically includes all default features
- Linux musl builds: explicitly list features, excluding any that need system C libs that can't musl-link
- Current Linux musl exclusion: `desktop-control` (wayland/xcb)
- If a new default feature requires system libs, decide: can it musl-link? Yes → include. No → exclude and document.

---

### Phase 8: Final Verification

Re-run ALL compilation gates after all edits:

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --workspace --all-features 2>&1 | grep "^test result:" | awk '{sum += $4} END {print "Tests: " sum}'
```

Confirm the test count matches what you wrote in README. If it doesn't, go back and fix.

---

### Phase 9: Commit

Stage only release-relevant files. Do NOT stage unrelated files.

```bash
git add Cargo.toml Cargo.lock README.md CLAUDE.md SETUP_FOR_PROS.md docs/dev/getting-started.md [any other changed files]
```

Commit with this format:
```bash
git commit -m "release: vX.Y.Z — one-line feature summary

Detailed bullet points of what changed.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

---

### Phase 10: Merge and Push

**If on a feature branch:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge <branch> --no-ff -m "Merge branch '<branch>' — vX.Y.Z summary"
git push origin main
```

**If on main directly (hotfix):**
```bash
git push origin main
```

**After push:** Wait for CI to pass. Fix any failures before proceeding to Phase 11.

---

### Phase 11: Tag and Release

**CRITICAL: GitHub Releases are triggered by git tags, NOT by commits.** Without a tag, no release binaries are built and `install.sh` users stay on the old version.

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggers on `v*` tags:
```yaml
if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
```

**Only tag after CI is green:**
```bash
# 1. Verify CI passed
gh run list --repo temm1e-labs/temm1e --limit 3

# 2. Create annotated tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z — one-line summary"

# 3. Push the tag (this triggers the release workflow)
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# 4. Monitor the release workflow
gh run list --repo temm1e-labs/temm1e --limit 5

# 5. Verify the release was created with artifacts
gh release view vX.Y.Z --repo temm1e-labs/temm1e
```

**What the tag triggers:**
- Release CI builds binaries for: x86_64-linux-musl, x86_64-macos, aarch64-macos
- Generates SHA256 checksums
- Creates a GitHub Release with download artifacts
- `install.sh` users will now get the new version

**Never tag before CI is green.** A tag triggers the release build immediately. If it fails, you need to delete the tag, fix, and re-tag:
```bash
# Emergency: delete a bad tag
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
# Fix the issue, then re-tag
```

**After release:** Verify artifacts on https://github.com/temm1e-labs/temm1e/releases

## Common Mistakes (Learned from Real Releases)

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Bump README but not Cargo.toml | `temm1e -V` shows old version | Always bump Cargo.toml FIRST |
| Forget test count in 3 README locations | Stale metrics visible to users | `grep -n "tests" README.md` |
| Forget architecture tree entry | New crate invisible in docs | `ls crates/` and cross-reference |
| Forget CLAUDE.md crate count | Claude starts with wrong context | Check every release |
| Push without re-running tests | Edits broke something | Phase 8 is mandatory |
| Feature-gated crate not in workspace members | `cargo check` doesn't catch errors | `grep members Cargo.toml` |
| Feature flag chain incomplete | `--features X` doesn't enable dependency | Root feature must enable child crate feature |
| MCP Playwright left in config | 5.7x cost multiplier, tool confusion | Removed in v3.4.0, don't re-add |
| Stale test count from earlier version | Users see wrong number, lose trust | Always re-count with `cargo test --all-features` |
| New crate needs C library, CI not updated | CI fails with `pkg-config ... not found` | Add `apt-get install` to CI check job |
| Clippy passes on macOS, fails on Linux CI | Platform-specific system deps missing | Test `--all-features` locally AND check CI deps |
| Feature-gated crate pulls in system lib | `--all-features` in CI triggers build of all crates | Add system dep to CI, or exclude feature from CI |

## Version History of This Protocol

- **v4 (v3.4.0, 2026-03-28):** Added Phase 11 "Tag and Release" — git tags trigger GitHub Releases. Without a tag, no binaries are built and install.sh stays on old version. Emergency tag deletion procedure included.
- **v3 (v3.4.0, 2026-03-28):** Added Phase 6 "Distribution Parity" — install.sh must match cargo install. Three-way sync (Cargo.toml defaults, release.yml, Dockerfile FEATURES). Platform gap documentation for musl builds. Triggered by user question about install.sh missing desktop-control.
- **v2 (v3.4.0 hotfix, 2026-03-28):** Added CI/CD section with system dependency management, common CI failure table, release.yml vs ci.yml feature scope distinction. Triggered by `wayland-sys` build failure in CI after desktop-control feature was added.
- **v1 (v3.4.0, 2026-03-28):** Created from Tem Gaze release. Covers: compilation gates, version bump, README (badges, test counts, architecture tree, release timeline, feature instructions), CLAUDE.md, SETUP_FOR_PROS.md, getting-started.md, Dockerfile, CI, merge workflow. Derived from actual mistakes made during the release process.
